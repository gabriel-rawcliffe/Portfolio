    blurb:
      'This was my a final group project at Dev Academy Aotearoa. Produced in under a week by myself and 4 other students, we utilised a JS library called Tone.js to produce a beat sequencer and 2 other musical toys. This was a complex project that relied completely on a tech-stack that none of the group had used prior, and that none of our facilitators had knowledge of. I pitched this idea and was the product owner of the project. I am incredibly proud of what we accomplished as a team. The version of the app linked here was modified by me after the conclusion of the project to make it more suitable for deployment.',
    contribution:
      'I coded all of the Free-form Synth feature, all aspects of the Save/Load functionality, made the animated bouncing lego blocks, debugged Play/Pause/Reset features, built the lego header, assisted in tracking "lights" feature, and helped to debug the beat sequencer component',
